# Similar work  
[WORK1_Tracking Grow-Finish Pigs Across Large Pens Using Multiple Cameras (CVPR2021_CV4Animals)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ecdUNkKhlcNxA0ZbvaZBc8qJdrLHAmUV/view):  
This work achieves multi-target tracking of pigs across cameras 🐖, However, this method relied solely on Intersection over Union (IoU) for matching each pig and did not incorporate appearance features.  

[WORK2_Estimating animal location from non-overhead camera views(Appl. Anim. Behav. Sci.)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159123002046)：  
This work applied georeferencing tools to link pixel coordinates to real-world coordinates by setting Ground Control Points (GCPs), thereby transforming video frames into a top-down view.However, thisstudy did not consider using multiple cameras simultaneously, and all animal localization processes required manual intervention, limiting the approach's broader applicability.

(The project is still ongoing, the complete data set remains under protection. Therefore, at this stage, we released part of the data set.)

  

============================================================   
  
Hi, there! We will continue to update the repo to more intuitively demonstrate the contribution of this work. We hope that it can promote the application of AI in animal husbandry to some extent.   
We thank the editors, reviewers and potential readers for their help. Best wishes for you!
